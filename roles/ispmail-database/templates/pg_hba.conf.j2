# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
# ===================================================
#
# Refer to the "Client Authentication" section in the PostgreSQL
# documentation for a complete description of this file.  A short
# synopsis follows.
#
# This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients
# are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use, which
# databases they can access.  Records take one of these forms:
#
# local      DATABASE  USER  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# host       DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostssl    DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostnossl  DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
#
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
#
# Database administrative login by Unix domain socket
local   all             postgres                                peer
# Local connection using user map
local   mailserver      all             peer                    map=mailmap
# Distant connection for mailservers over md5
{% for mailserver in mailservers %}
host    mailserver      mail            {{ mailserver.ip }}/32            md5
{% endfor %}
# Distant connection for admin
host    mailserver      pgadmin         {{ ispmail_pgadmin_ip_range }}            md5
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 md5
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     peer
