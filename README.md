# ISPmail Ansible Playbook #

This repository contains a playbook and roles that you can use to set up your
own Debian-based mail server. Behind the scenes, it makes use of postfix,
 dovecot, postgresql.

This is a modified version of the original repo:
(https://git.workaround.org/chaas/ansible-ispmail-jessie/)

Modifications include:
* use of postgres
* rewrite in ansible-style
* tests and CI
* webmail removed

# Development

## Dependencies

* vagrant
* ansible 2.6
* python 3
* virtualbox (other virts may work too)
* molecule
* docker

## Setting up

* Clone the repository
* `cd ansible-mailserver`
* *If you want to use a virtual environment make sure it is activated here*

You can use vagrant:

* `vagrant up` will create 3 VMs: the mailservers (north and south) and the tester

Or you can use molecule in docker:

* molecule converge

## Running tests

### With molecule

* `molecule test` or `molecule test -s single` will run the full test suite

### With vagrant

Tests are  manually started:
* `vagrant ssh tester`
* `cd suite`
* `pytest`

Test suites `test_imap.py` and `test_smtp.py` hit by default
`north.mail.local`. The target can be configured with the flag `--server`.
