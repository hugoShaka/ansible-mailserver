 dovecot, postgresql.

# Development

## Dependencies

* vagrant
* ansible 2.6
* python 3
* virtualbox (other virts may work too)

## Setting up

* Clone the repository
* `cd ansible-mailserver`
* *If you've installed ansible in a venv make sure it is activated here*
* `vagrant up` will create 3 VMs : the mailservers (north and south) and the tester

## Running tests

Tests are still manually started.
* `vagrant ssh tester`
* `cd suite`
* `pytest <yourtestfile.py> [--server south.mail.local]`

Test suites `imap.py` and `incoming-email.py` hits by default
`north.mail.local`. The target can be configured with the flag `--server`.
